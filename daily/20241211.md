### 🗓️ So

##### 👈 What I **did** yesterday

- Continue with Java course

##### 🏫 What I **learn** yesterday

- How use Arrays in Java
  - for each that have different syntax than js `for (<type> item : items) {}`
  - print an Array require the Arrays class with the toString method `Arrays.toString(list)`
- Class in Java
  - Access modifier: Default, Public, Private, Protected
    - **Default** is implicit if we doest not declare a sentence, are accessible **only in the same package**
    - **Public** make the variable accessible everywhere in the program
    - **Private** make the variable accessible only inside the Class, we can modify or read the variable with Setters and Getters
    - **Protected**
  - Static directive
    - if a variable, method or class is declared as static, we can access or invoked with out generate an instance before (example declare static pi variable and use the constant without generate an instance)
  - Method or constructors overflow
    - We can declare a method or constructor with the same name n times, but every declaration must receive a different type or argument, this is helpful to manage different arguments types
  - We can generate a variable as constant with the keyword `final`

##### 🚀 What I plan to do today

- Finish Java course
- Continue with Portfolio

- Plan a project in Java

##### 👎 One thing I'm struggling with today
