# algorithms

ways to develop a usable algorithm

- Model the problem
- find an algorithm to solve it

- A quadratic algorithms scales bad, when more the input more time take

## Data Types

- Stack
- Queue
- Bag
- Union-find
  - Search for two nodes connected, we can union nodes or ask if two nodes are connected
  - connected components, maximal set of objects that are mutually connected
  - connected components are groups of items connected.
- Priority Queue

## Sorting

- quicksort
- mergesort
- heapsort

## searching

- BST
