# Dijkstra

Dijkstra algorithm is a popular algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

> [!NOTE]
> Dijkstra's is a greedy algorithm, which means that will find the shortest path searching in the whole graph.


## Example

#### Dijkstra using a matrix
```js
const dijkstra = (matrix, [startX, startY], [endX, endY]) => {
  // Create a matrix with max distance values
  const distance = matrix.map(row => row.map(cel => Infinity));
  // Set the start point distance to 0
  distance[startX][startY] = 0;
  const queue = []

  while (queue.length) {
    // Get the first element in the queue
    const [x, y] = queue.shift()
    // Check if the element is the end point
    if (x === endX && y === endY) {
      // Return the distance
      return distance[x][y]
    }

    // Get the neighbors of the current element (how can we move to the next element, ex. right, left, up, down)
    const neighbors = getNeighbors(x, y)
    // Loop through the neighbors
    neighbors.forEach(([nx, ny]) => {
      // Check if the neighbor is already in the queue
      if (!queue.includes([nx, ny])) {
        // Add the neighbor to the queue
        queue.push([nx, ny])
      }
      // Check if the neighbor is already in the distance matrix
      if (distance[nx][ny] === Infinity) {
        // Set the distance to the neighbor
        distance[nx][ny] = distance[x][y] + 1
      }
    })
  }

}

```
