## IAM Custom Roles

We can create custom roles to asign to users or groups, and follow the least privilege principle, that means we only gave the minimum permissions to do the tasks its needed.
Permissions are represented by service, resource and action, for example: `<service>.<resource>.<verb>` `compute.instances.create` `compute.instances.delete`
We only can use custom roles to grant permissions for the same project or organization that owns the role or resource under them.

To create a custom roles we need ensure that we have `iam.roles.create` permission

#### View the available permissions for a resource
- `gcloud iam list-testeable-permissions --resource-type compute.instances`
- See available permissions for a project: `gcloud iam list-testable-permissions //cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID`

#### Get the role metadata
Role metadata contained the role name and both predefined and custom roles associated with that role
- `gcloud iam roles describe $ROLE_NAME`

#### View the grantable roles on resources
- `gcloud iam list-grantable-roles --resource-type compute.instances`
- See grantable roles for a project: `gcloud iam list-grantable-roles //cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID`
> [!NOTE] Difference between grantable roles and testeable permissions.

#### Create a custom role
- We can create a custom role in two ways:
  - With a YAML file that contains the role definition
  - Specify the role definition in the CLI using flags
Creating a role with YAML file:
```yaml
title: My Custom Role
description: My custom role
stage: GA
includedPermissions:
- cloudresourcemanager.projects.get
- compute.instances.create
- compute.instances.delete
```
`gcloud iam roles create my-custom-role --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID --file=my-custom-role.yaml`

Creating a role with CLI flags:
```
gcloud iam roles create my-custom-role \
  --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID \
  --title="My Custom Role" \
  --description="My custom role" \
  --permissions=cloudresourcemanager.projects.get,compute.instances.create,compute.instances.delete \
  --stage=ALPHA
```
> [!NOTE]
> launch stage stage of a role in the launch lifecycle, can be one of ALPHA, BETA, GA

#### List the custom roles
`gcloud iam roles list --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID`

#### Update an existing custom role
`gcloud iam roles update`
We follow the same process from creating a custom role from yaml file, we use the custom role id, and we get the current config with `gcloud iam roles describe <role-id> --proejct=<project>`, then we update the config and create the role again.
Using the CLI we have specific flags to update, for example: `--add-permissions`, `--remove-permissions`, or just replace the current permissions with `--permissions`

#### Disable a custom role
We can disable a custom role changing the stage to `DISABLED`
`gcloud iam roles update my-custom-role --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID --stage=DISABLED`

#### Delete a custom role
`gcloud iam roles delete my-custom-role --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID`
After this process, the role can be undeleted within 7 days, then enter in permanent deletion process for 30 days, after that 37 days the role id can be used again.

#### Restore a custom role
In the period of 7 days after the role is deleted: `gcloud iam roles undelete my-custom-role --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID`
Restored role have the `DISABLED` stage.

## Service Accounts and Roles: Fundamentals
Service accounts are used to grant permissions to VMs or applications instead of end users. It useful to ensure safe, managed connections to APIs and GC Services
Three types of service accounts:
- User managed service accounts
  - Is created by default with a new Cloud project
  - `PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`
- Google managed service accounts
  - Different google services accounts that represent different google services and gave IAM roles to access to our Google Cloud project
- Google APIs service accounts
  - `PROJECT_NUMBER@cloudservices.gserviceaccount.com`

#### Create and manage service accounts
- `gcloud iam service-accounts create <service-account-name> --display-name=<display-name>`
- Granting role to a service account `gcloud projects add-iam-poilcy-binding <project-id> --member serviceAccount:<service-account-email> --role roles/editor`

#### Use the client libraries to access
