# Week 5

# Implement Cloud Security Fundamentals Google Cloud

## [[1727975536-week-2|Cloud IAM: Qwick Start]]

## IAM Custom Roles

We can create custom roles to asign to users or groups, and follow the least privilege principle, that means we only gave the minimum permissions to do the tasks its needed.
Permissions are represented by service, resource and action, for example: `<service>.<resource>.<verb>` `compute.instances.create` `compute.instances.delete`
We only can use custom roles to grant permissions for the same project or organization that owns the role or resource under them.

To create a custom roles we need ensure that we have `iam.roles.create` permission

#### View the available permissions for a resource
- `gcloud iam list-testeable-permissions --resource-type compute.instances`
- See available permissions for a project: `gcloud iam list-testable-permissions //cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID`

#### Get the role metadata
Role metadata contained the role name and both predefined and custom roles associated with that role
- `gcloud iam roles describe $ROLE_NAME`

#### View the grantable roles on resources
- `gcloud iam list-grantable-roles --resource-type compute.instances`
- See grantable roles for a project: `gcloud iam list-grantable-roles //cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID`
> [!NOTE] Difference between grantable roles and testeable permissions.

#### Create a custom role
- We can create a custom role in two ways:
  - With a YAML file that contains the role definition
  - Specify the role definition in the CLI using flags
Creating a role with YAML file:
```yaml
title: My Custom Role
description: My custom role
stage: GA
includedPermissions:
- cloudresourcemanager.projects.get
- compute.instances.create
- compute.instances.delete
```
`gcloud iam roles create my-custom-role --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID --file=my-custom-role.yaml`

Creating a role with CLI flags:
```
gcloud iam roles create my-custom-role \
  --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID \
  --title="My Custom Role" \
  --description="My custom role" \
  --permissions=cloudresourcemanager.projects.get,compute.instances.create,compute.instances.delete \
  --stage=ALPHA
```
> [!NOTE]
> launch stage stage of a role in the launch lifecycle, can be one of ALPHA, BETA, GA

#### List the custom roles
`gcloud iam roles list --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID`

#### Update an existing custom role
`gcloud iam roles update`
We follow the same process from creating a custom role from yaml file, we use the custom role id, and we get the current config with `gcloud iam roles describe <role-id> --proejct=<project>`, then we update the config and create the role again.
Using the CLI we have specific flags to update, for example: `--add-permissions`, `--remove-permissions`, or just replace the current permissions with `--permissions`

#### Disable a custom role
We can disable a custom role changing the stage to `DISABLED`
`gcloud iam roles update my-custom-role --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID --stage=DISABLED`

#### Delete a custom role
`gcloud iam roles delete my-custom-role --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID`
After this process, the role can be undeleted within 7 days, then enter in permanent deletion process for 30 days, after that 37 days the role id can be used again.

#### Restore a custom role
In the period of 7 days after the role is deleted: `gcloud iam roles undelete my-custom-role --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID`
Restored role have the `DISABLED` stage.

## Service Accounts and Roles: Fundamentals
Service accounts are used to grant permissions to VMs or applications instead of end users. It useful to ensure safe, managed connections to APIs and GC Services
Three types of service accounts:
- User managed service accounts
  - Is created by default with a new Cloud project
  - `PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`
- Google managed service accounts
  - Different google services accounts that represent different google services and gave IAM roles to access to our Google Cloud project
- Google APIs service accounts
  - `PROJECT_NUMBER@cloudservices.gserviceaccount.com`

#### Create and manage service accounts
- `gcloud iam service-accounts create <service-account-name> --display-name=<display-name>`
- Granting role to a service account `gcloud projects add-iam-poilcy-binding <project-id> --member serviceAccount:<service-account-email> --role roles/editor`

#### Use the client libraries to access BigQuery using a service account
Query a BigQuery public datasets from a VM instance with a service account that has necessary roles
- Create a service account with Console
  - Go to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts
  - Click Create Service Account
  - Add roles
- We can assign the Service account name to the VM instance
- Now we can do a query to BigQuery using the service account using the `compute_engine` library on python, for example:

```python
from google.auth import compute_engine
from google.cloud import bigquery

credentials = compute_engine.Credentials(
    service_account_email='YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT')

query = '''
SELECT
  year,
  COUNT(1) as num_babies
FROM
  publicdata.samples.natality
WHERE
  year > 2000
GROUP BY
  year
'''

client = bigquery.Client(
    project=,
    credentials=credentials)
print(client.query(query).to_dataframe())
```

## VPC Network Peering
Connect two VPC networks regardless of whether they are in the same project or organization

#### Set up a VPC network peering session
First each admin of each project need to configure the peering association

- VPC Network > VPC network peering
- Create connection
- set a name to the connection
- Under **Your VPC network** select out vpc network name
- set **Peered VPC network** to **In another project** and add the project id from the other project
- In **VPC network name** set the other network vpc name
- **Create** 

We do the same with the other project
We can test the connection by open an SSH session on the instance of one project and to a ping to the INTERNAL_IP for the VM instance in the other projects

![Network Peering Example](/file/network-peering-ab.png) 
![Network Peering Example](/file/network-peering-ba.png) 
![Network Peering Example](/file/network-peering.png) 

- We can list the peering connections with `gcloud compute routes list --project=<project-id>`

## User Authentication: Identity-Aware Proxy
Here we will create a minimal web app using Google App engine and then we will use IAP to restrict access to the app provide user identity info

#### Restrict access with IAP
- Once created our app engine with our app running
- **Security** > **Identity-Aware Proxy** and enable it
- Create an IAP with user type as Internal
- Add URL from the app
- Add the privacy page from the app
- On authorized domains and add the hostname of the app
Now when we try to access to the app we will be required to login with our google account, but we will se a denying screen
We need to add which account to allow on IAP
- Add Principal
- Add the email of the user
- Pick **Cloud IAP** > **IAP-Secured Web App User** role  
Now we can access to the app with our user email

#### Access user identity information
We can access to the identity of loged user with headers, for example: `user_email = request.headers.get('X-Goog-Authenticated-User-Email')`

#### Use Cryptographic Verification
If we disabled or out IAP is bypassed, we don't have any way to verify information and users can access to our app anyway, for this we use cryptographic verification
We have another request header added called `X-Goog-IAP-JWT-Assertion` that contains the JWT token, we can use this token to verify the identity of the user
```python
def user():
    assertion = request.headers.get('X-Goog-IAP-JWT-Assertion')
    if assertion is None:
        return None, None

  # Decode the JWT token
    info = jwt.decode(
        assertion,
        keys(),
        algorithms=['ES256'],
        audience=audience()
    )

    return info['email'], info['sub']
```

## Getting Started with Cloud [[KMS]]

#### Enable Cloud KMS
- IAM > Service Accounts > Cloud KMS or `gcloud services enable cloudkms.googleapis.com`

#### Create a keyring and Cryptokey
- KeyRings are used for grouping keys and can be grouped by environment or by some other conceptual grouping
  - `gcloud kms keyrings create <keyring-name> --location <location>`
- Cryptokeys are used for encrypting and decrypting data
 - `gcloud kms keys create <key-name> --location <location> --keyring <keyring-name> --purpose <purpose>`
- In Console the keys will be on **Security** > **Key Management**  


#### Encrypt your data
- Transform the data into plaintext using base64 encoding
- Send the base64-encoded text to a specific key 
```
curl -v "https://cloudkms.googleapis.com/v1/projects/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/locations/global/keyRings/$KEYRING_NAME/cryptoKeys/$CRYPTOKEY_NAME:encrypt" \
  -d "{\"plaintext\":\"$PLAINTEXT\"}" \
  -H "Authorization:Bearer $(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token)"\
  -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
| jq .ciphertext -r > 1.encrypted
```
> [!NOTE]
> the jq command is used to extract the encrypted text from the response
- the response will be saved on a file called `1.encrypted`
- To descrypt the data we use:
```
curl -v "https://cloudkms.googleapis.com/v1/projects/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/locations/global/keyRings/$KEYRING_NAME/cryptoKeys/$CRYPTOKEY_NAME:decrypt" \
  -d "{\"ciphertext\":\"$(cat 1.encrypted)\"}" \
  -H "Authorization:Bearer $(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token)"\
  -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
| jq .plaintext -r | base64 -d
```
- We transform the response and process the base64 text

#### Configure IAM permissions
- Exist two major permissions to focus on, first that allow to manage kms resources `cloudkms.admin` and other that allow to users or service accounts to use keys yo encrypt or decrypt data `cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter`
- Assign a kms role to a user:
  - `gcloud kms keyrings add-iam-policy-binding <keyring-name> --location=<location> --member=user:<user-email> --role=<cloudkms-role>`

## Setting up a Private Kubernetes Cluster
A private cluster is a clster that makes your master inaccessible to a public internet, we dont have public ip addresses, only private.
We communicate masteres with each other using VPC peering

#### Creating a private cluster
- Creating a private cluster
  - Kubernetes Engine will create automatically subnetworks when we enable IP aliases
  - we need to specify a /28 cidr range 
  - we create the private cluster using the --private-cluster, --master-ipvc-4-cidr and --enable-ip-alias flags
```
gcloud beta container clusters create <cluster-name> \
    --enable-private-nodes \
    --master-ipv4-cidr <cidr-range>/28 \
    --enable-ip-alias \
    --create-subnetwork ""
```

- We associate the private cluster with our VM

```
gcloud container clusters update <cluster-name> \
    --enable-master-authorized-networks \
    --master-authorized-networks [MY_EXTERNAL_RANGE]
```
> [!NOTE]
> External range is the external ip from de vm with /32
> We can get the external ip with `gcloud compute instances describe <vm-name> --zone=$ZONE | grep natIP`

#### Create a private cluster that uses a custom subnetwork

- We can create a private clauster with a specific subnetwork with the `--subnetwork=<subnet-name> --services-secondary-range-name=<subnet-secondary-name> --cluster-secondary-range-name=<cluster-secondary-name>` flags
- this secondary names will be created when we create a subnet, for example:
```
gcloud compute networks subnets create <subnet-name> \
    --network default \
    --range 10.0.4.0/22 \
    --enable-private-ip-google-access \
    --region=$REGION \
    --secondary-range my-svc-range=10.0.32.0/20,my-pod-range=10.4.0.0/14
```

- adding an instance to the private cluster

`gcloud container clusters create $CLUSTER --num-nodes 1 --master-ipv4-cidr=172.16.0.64/28 --network orca-build-vpc --subnetwork orca-build-subnet --enable-master-authorized-networks --master-authorized-networks 192.168.10.2/32 --enable-ip-alias --enable-private-nodes --enable-private-endpoint --service-account $SERVICE_ACCOUNT@$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com --zone $ZONE`

> [!NOTE]
> for the Lab the --master-authorized-network is the internal ip of the vm becouse there are in different vpn networks
> the --master-ipv4-cidr are the ...
