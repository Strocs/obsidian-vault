# Lab: Build a Secure Google Cloud Network

## Securing Virtual Machines using BeyondCorp Enterprise (BCE)

How to give access to VM Instances that not have external IP address or do not permit direct access over the internet?
Is possible use [[1729634015-beyondcrop-enterprise|BeyondCrop Enterprise]] (BCE) or [[1729601461-identity-aware-proxy|Identity-aware Proxy]] [[1729601581-transmission-control-protocol-tcp|TCP]]

- How enable [[1729601461-identity-aware-proxy|IAP]] [[1729601581-transmission-control-protocol-tcp|TCP]] forwarding
- Test connectivities between instances
- Configure firewalls rules for BCP
- Grant permissions to use that IAP TCP forwarding
- Demonstrate tunneling using [[1729601391-ssh|SSH]] and [[1729603547-remote-desktop-protocol-rdp|Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)]] connections.

> we use iap to sgenerate secure connections of users to our private vms without external IP address, so we can manage who can access to our vms in a secure way.
> We use iap TCP to allow users connect to our private network without asign an external ip, creating a secure tunnel using the user credentials, avoiding the need to open ports in the firewall.

#### Enable IAP TCP forwarding in your Google Cloud project

> To use IAP TCP first we need to enable from the API section

- Using the Google Console go to **APIs and Services** > **Library**
- Search for IAP, select **Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy API** and enable it

#### Configure the required firewall rules for BCE

> Here we configure a firewall to allow connection to our VMs

- On **VCP Network** > **Firewall** > click **Create Firewall Rule**
- Create a firewall rule that target all instances in the network, with ingress direction of traffic

#### Grant permissions to use IAP TCP forwarding

> We grant permissions to users for make connections through our VMs without External IP, configuring iap.tunnelResourceAccessor role

- On **Security** > **Identity-Aware Proxy** switch to the **SSH and TCP Resources** tab
- Select instances to affect
- **Add principal**
- **Cloud IAP** > **IAP-Secured Tunnel User** for the role, then save

#### Use IAP Desktop to connect to the Windows and Linux instances

> We use IAP Desktop on our public VM to connect to the Windows and Linux instances

#### Demonstrate tunneling using SSH and RDP connections

## Multiple VPC Networks

[[1729731486-virtual-private-cloud|VPC]] networks allow us to maintain an isolated environments, giving us a granular control.

In this lab we will create customs vpc networks modes with firewall rules and explore the connectivity for vm instances across vpc networks

#### Create custom mode VPC networks with firewall rules

- We create a VPC network to allow SSH, ICMP and RDP ingress traffic

> To investigate: What are a subnets? How I know the IP ranges for subnets?
> Subnet are a subdivition to segment our resources in differents ip ranges and is associate with a specific region

- We can click on **EQUIVALENT COMMAND LINE** to see that all we can do in console we can do it in shell

- We use `gcloud compute networks create <network-name> --subnet-mode=custom` to create a network
- To create a subnet `gcloud compute networks subnets create <subnet-name> --network=<network-name> --range=<subnet-range> --region=<region>`

- To list all VPC networks `gcloud compute networks list`
- To list all subnets `gcloud compute networks subnets list --sort-by=<something>`

> [!NOTE]
> the default networks have subnets in all regions, with custom we can control where we create subnets

- create firewalls rules for both networks

- we can list firewall rules `gcloud compute firewall-rules list`

> To investigate: Difference between internal and external ip address
> internal ips only allow connection between a same vpc network, external ips allow connections between other networks

- We can create vm instances in multiple vpc networks, based on the type of machine we are selecting
  - if are multiple vms in a vpc network, on our instance with multiples networks we are able to connect just ot the first interface unles manually configure otherwise
